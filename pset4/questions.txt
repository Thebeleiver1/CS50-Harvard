0. GIF support 256 colors. JPEG, PNG and BMP 24bit support over 16 million which is 16,777,216 colors. 

1. GIF

2.  Lossless means that every single bits is recovered after uncompression and lossy means that the format compress itself by eliminating certain bits.

3.  JPEG

4.  When a file is deleted from a file system, most operating systems do not overwrite the blocks on
    the hard disk that the file is written on. Instead, they simply remove the file’s reference from the
    containing directory. The file’s blocks are then placed on the free list. Which can be easily retrieved using undelete tools and utilities.

5.  I will use a third party disk erasing tools tools or sanitization tools which claims to erase all the data which cannot be recoverd.

6.  stdint.h is a standard c library which have different support types as int8_t, int16_t which have additional properties, such as providing storage with and exact size. Which let us to play with image.

7.  uint means unsigned integer so uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t doesn't hold any value so we have to define it in other hand int32_t hold a specific size.

8.  BYTE is 8 bits so 1 byte.
    DWORD is 32 bits 4 byte.
    LONG is 32 bits 4 byte.
    WORD is 16 bits 2 byte.
    
9.  The first tow decimal value of BMP file are magic number 66 and 67 "BM".

10. bfsize is the filesize where bisize is the size of overall headersize.

11. If biheight is negative BMP is top - down with the origin at left corner.

12. biBitCount .

13. If it cannot find the given file it can't open it so in that case it will return NULL.

14. Because this is the number of elements, each one with a size of size bytes.

15. The padding would be 3 if bi.width is 3 .

16. It moves to a specific location in file.

17. It moves to the current position of file pointer.
